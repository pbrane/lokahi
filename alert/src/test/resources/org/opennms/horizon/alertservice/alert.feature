Feature: Alert Service Basic Functionality

  Background: Configure base URLs
    Given Application base HTTP URL in system property "application.base-http-url"
    Given Application base gRPC URL in system property "application.base-grpc-url"
    Given Kafka bootstrap URL in system property "kafka.bootstrap-servers"
    Given Kafka event topic "events"
    Given Kafka alert topic "alerts"
    Given Kafka tag topic "tag-operation"
    Given A new tenant
    And A monitoring policy named "my-policy" with tag "tag1"
    And The policy has a rule named "my-rule" with component type "NODE" and trap definitions
      | trigger_event_name | count | overtime | overtime_unit | severity | clear_event_name |
      | SNMP Link Down     | 1     | 0        | MINUTE        | MINOR    |                  |
      | SNMP Link Up       | 1     | 0        | MINUTE        | CLEARED  | SNMP Link Down   |
      | SNMP Cold Start    | 1     | 0        | MINUTE        | MAJOR    |                  |
      | SNMP Warm Start    | 1     | 0        | MINUTE        | CRITICAL |                  |
    And The policy is created in the tenant
    And Tag operations are applied to the tenant
      | action     | name | node_ids |
      | ASSIGN_TAG | tag1 | 10       |
    Then Verify list tag with size 1 and node ids
      | 10 |

  Scenario: When an event is received from Kafka, a new alert is created
    When An event is sent with UEI "uei.opennms.org/generic/traps/SNMP_Link_Down" on node 10
    Then List alerts for the tenant, with timeout 15000ms, until JSON response matches the following JSON path expressions
      | alerts.size() == 1          |
      | alerts[0].counter == 1      |
      | alerts[0].severity == MINOR |
    Then Verify alert topic has 1 messages for the tenant
    Then Verify valid monitoring policy ID is set in alert for the tenant

  Scenario: When an event is received from Kafka, with no matching alert configuration, no new alert is created
    When An event is sent with UEI "uei.opennms.org/perspective/nodes/nodeLostService" on node 10
