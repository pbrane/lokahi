:description: How to managed network inventory in OpenNMS Lōkahi/Cloud: add nodes to monitored category, create and add tags to a node, remove nodes from inventory.

Node management involves assessing the nodes that OpenNMS Cloud has identified on your network and determining whether you want to monitor them.
See xref:inventory/introduction.adoc[inventory management] for a detailed description of node categories (monitored, unmonitored, and detected).

In cases where OpenNMS has not identified any nodes, the screen displays a message with a button that takes you do the discovery page where you can xref:get-started/discovery/introduction.adoc[create a discovery] to identify nodes and add them to your network monitoring inventory.

NOTE: Remember that node discovery and management are iterative processes.
You may identify nodes that OpenNMS is currently monitoring that you don't want to monitor or think would fit better in a different monitoring policy.

== Add nodes to the monitored nodes category

Unmonitored and detected nodes are nodes that OpenNMS Cloud is not monitoring.
In the case of unmonitored nodes, OpenNMS discovered the nodes, but they did not match any of the criteria in your monitoring policies.
Detected nodes were identified indirectly, and have not gone through a discovery process.

To start monitoring these nodes, you need to xref:get-started/policies/create.adoc[create a monitoring policy] that uses tags or other criteria to identify them as nodes you want to monitor.
You can also optionally use tags to categorize and identify these nodes.

=== Create tags and add them to a node

A tag is an optional, arbitrary label that you can associate with a node or device and its components, alerts, events, Minions, and network monitoring policies.
It allows for easy and flexible filtering and grouping of devices.

A tag can be any word or number.
We recommend that you define a tagging scheme that works for your organization, and that will allow for the most robust or granular filtering you need.
For example, you may want to create tags based on the following:

* Device type: storage, network, security, router, server.
* Location: building 1, building 2, London, New York.
* Service: Email, VoIP.
* Employee name: Bob Smith, Jane Doe.
* Any arbitrary word.

To create a tag, follow these steps:

. Click *Inventory* in the left navigation menu.
. Click on the node tab that displays the nodes you want to tag.
. Click *Tag Manager*.
. In the *Search Tags* field, type a name for the tag and click on the word when it appears in the drop-down list.
+
Tags that already exist will appear in the drop-down list.
+
The tag appears on the right and all nodes listed are available to add tags to.
It also becomes available in the drop-down list for selection in subsequent node tagging.
. (optional) Repeat to create more tags.
. Click the checkbox on each node that you want to add the tag or tags to or click *Select All*.
. Click *Save Tags to Node*.
+
The tags label on the node indicates the number of tags associated with the node.

=== Delete tags from a node

To remove tags from a node, follow these steps:

. Click *Inventory* in the left navigation menu.
. Click on the node tab that displays the node from which you want to remove the tag.
. Click the *Tags* label on the node.
. Click on the tag or tags you want to remove and click *Delete*.

== Remove nodes you do not want to monitor

Note that removing a node from monitoring removes it only until the next time a discovery runs that contains the same tags as the deleted node or if the node matches an existing monitoring policy.
If you do not want the node to appear again the next time the discovery runs, you can update the discovery to skip over nodes that you do not want to monitor. 
After modifying the discovery, you can delete the node.

//how do we prevent a deleted node from being discovered again the next time the discovery runs? Is the suggestion above correct?

To remove a node from a monitoring list, follow these steps:

. Click *Inventory* in the left navigation menu.
. Click on the node tab that displays the node you do not want to monitor.
. Click the *delete* symbol on the node card.
. When prompted to confirm deletion, click *Delete*.

== View detailed node information

View detailed information about the node, including its SNMP and IP interfaces, events, and alarms by clicking the *i* symbol on the node card.

== Search nodes
You can search and filter nodes by tags or labels.
//What is a label? Where does it come from? You can't create it anywhere in the UI.
