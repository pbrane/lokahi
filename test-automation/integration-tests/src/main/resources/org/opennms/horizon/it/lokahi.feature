      # Delete the node {string} from inventory in location {string}
      # The following has errors, but with deleting the tenant, we can ignore for now.

    Then Read the list of connected Minions from the BFF
    Then Find the minions running in the given location
    Then Read the "response_time_msec" metrics with label "instance" set to the Minion System ID for each Minion found with timeout 120000ms

    Then Location "Measurements" does not exist
    Then Minion "Stuart" is stopped

  @metrics
  Scenario: Add devices and verify monitoring metrics are recorded into prometheus
    Then Create location "Metrics"

    Then At least one Minion is running with location "Metrics"
    Then Add a device with label "local1" IP address "127.1.0.1" and location "Metrics"
    Then Add a device with label "local2" IP address "127.1.0.2" and location "Metrics"
    Then Add a device with label "local3" IP address "127.1.0.3" and location "Metrics"
    Then Read the "response_time_msec" metrics with label "ip_address" set to "127.1.0.1" with timeout 120000ms
    Then Read the "response_time_msec" metrics with label "ip_address" set to "127.1.0.2" with timeout 120000ms
    Then Read the "response_time_msec" metrics with label "ip_address" set to "127.1.0.3" with timeout 120000ms
    Then Delete the first node from inventory
    Then Delete the first node from inventory
    Then Delete the first node from inventory
    When Location "Metrics" is removed
    Then Location "Metrics" does not exist
    Then Minion "Bob" is stopped

  @nodeStatus
  Scenario: Create a Node and check it status
    Then Create location "NodeStatus"
    Then Location "NodeStatus" do exist
    Then Request certificate for location "NodeStatus"
    When Minion "Carl" is started with shared networking in location "NodeStatus"
    Then At least one Minion is running with location "NodeStatus"
    Then Add a device with label "NodeUp" IP address "127.1.0.4" and location "NodeStatus"
    Then Check the status of the Node with expected status "UP"
    Then Delete the first node from inventory
    Then Add a device with label "NodeDown" IP address "192.168.0.4" and location "NodeStatus"
    Then Check the status of the Node with expected status "DOWN"
    Then Delete the first node from inventory
    When Location "NodeStatus" is removed
    Then Location "NodeStatus" does not exist
    Then Minion "Carl" is stopped

  @nodeDiscovery
  Scenario: Create discovery and check the status of the discovered node
    Then Create location "NodeDiscovery"
    Then Location "NodeDiscovery" do exist
    Then Request certificate for location "NodeDiscovery"
    When Minion "Dave" is started with shared networking in location "NodeDiscovery"
    Then At least one Minion is running with location "NodeDiscovery"
  # Currently this test is using Minion open port 161 to make a discovery. In future would be preferred to use container with open ports
    Then Add a new active discovery for the name "Automation Discovery Tests" at location "NodeDiscovery" with ip address "127.1.0.5" and port 161, readCommunities "public"
    Then Check the status of the Node with expected status "UP"
    Then Delete the first node from inventory
    When Location "NodeDiscovery" is removed
